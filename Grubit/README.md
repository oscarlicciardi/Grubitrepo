# Project Name

Grubit

# Project Description

This app would allow truckers to scan for trucks (and retrieve info about the related logistics company). The more photos about rare companies' trucks are acquired, the more points the truck driver will collect (in order to redeem prizes).

# Project Goal

The goal, for Gruber Logistics, is to obtain contact and relevant info about other logistics companies in order to potentially partner or collaborate with them.

# Technologies used

For the frontend, the project relies on React Native and mainly expo modules. For the backend, C#, sqlite and ASP.NET are being used. 
Development, deployment and testing have been performed using:
• React 18.2.0;
• React-native 0.72.6;
• Watchman 2023.07.10.00;
• Node 19.8.1;
• npm 9.6.0;
• macOS 14.0 (x64);
• Windows 11 (x86);
• XCode 15.0.1;
• Sqlite;
• VS Code 1.83.1.


# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
